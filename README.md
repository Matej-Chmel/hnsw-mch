# Custom HNSW implementation
This is my implementation of the Hiearchical Navigable Small World (HNSW) data structure proposed by Malkov, Yu A., and D. A. Yashunin.

Their implementation can be found at [github](https://github.com/nmslib/hnswlib).

## Why Python?
Although Python is not suitable for developing memory-intensive datastructures, I will temporarily implement this project in Python to lay out the basic concepts in shorter development time.

## Supported platforms
- Linux
- Windows

## Workspace
Supports Visual Studio Code. Program can be run from tasks (Terminal -> Run task).
