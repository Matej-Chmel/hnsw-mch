# Custom HNSW implementation
This is my implementation of the Hiearchical Navigable Small World (HNSW) data structure proposed by Malkov, Yu A., and D. A. Yashunin.

Their implementation can be found at [github](https://github.com/nmslib/hnswlib).

## Supported platforms
- Linux
- Windows

## Workspace
Supports Visual Studio Code. Program can be run from tasks (Terminal -> Run task).
