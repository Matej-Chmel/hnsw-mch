# Graphs

This is the default destination for built graphs. To change it pass a different `output_dir_path` argument to the [graph builder](../../src/graph_builder.cpp).

## Visual Studio Code
You can change the argument value in the [task definitions](../../.vscode/tasks.json#L71).

## Visual Studio 2019
You can change the argument value in the [launch options](../../launch.vs.json#L25). Notice that there are multiple launch tasks and the value has to be changed for each to be consistent.
