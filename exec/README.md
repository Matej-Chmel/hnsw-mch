# VS Code endpoint

> Warning: When compiling with `gcc` from VS Code, this directory is expected to exist. You can change this in [task definitions](../.vscode/tasks.json).

This directory should contain executables produced without CMake. CMake executables instead use their own folder named `out` which it creates automatically.
